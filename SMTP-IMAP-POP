What is SMTP?
            SMTP "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". Handle the "sending of emails". In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, 
            comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail.

            The SMTP server performs three basic functions:
                                        Verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
                                        Sends the outgoing mail
                                        If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to the sender
POP and IMAP?
            POP"Post Office Protocol" & IMAP"Internet Message Access Protocol" are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and 
            a mail server. 
            POP downloads the inbox from the mail server, to the client. 
            IMAP synchronise the current inbox with mail on the server, downloading anything new!! 
                This means that changes to the inbox made on one computer will persist if you then synchronise the inbox from another computer!
            

How does SMTP work?

Email delivery functions much the same as the physical mail delivery system. The user will supply the email (a letter) and a service (the postal delivery service), 
and through a series of steps- will deliver it to the recipients inbox (postbox). The role of the SMTP server in this service, is to act as the sorting office, 
the email (letter) is picked up and sent to this server, which then directs it to the recipient.
We can map the journey of an email from your computer to the recipientâ€™s like this:

1. The mail user agent, which is either your email client connects to the SMTP server of your domain,This initiates the SMTP handshake.
This connection works over the SMTP port- which is usually 25. Once these connections have been made and validated,the SMTP session starts.

2. Sending mail can now begin. The client first submits the sender, and recipient's email address- the body of the email and any attachments, to the server.

3. SMTP server checks whether the domain name of the recipient and the sender is the same.

4. SMTP server of the sender will make a connection to the recipient's SMTP server. If the recipient's server can't be accessed, or is not available- 
   the Email gets put into an SMTP queue.

5. Recipient's SMTP server will verify the incoming email. It does this by checking if the domain and user name have been recognised. The server will then forward email 
   to the POP or IMAP server!!!

6. The E-Mail will then show up in the recipient's inbox.
