Volume Shadow Copies 		VSS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VSSare stored on the System Volume Information folder on each drive that has protection enabled.
	If VSS is enabled (System Protection turned on), you can perform the following tasks from within advanced system settings. 
		Create a restore point
		Perform system restore
		Configure restore settings
		Delete restore points
From a security perspective, malware writers know of this Windows feature and write code in their malware to look for these files and delete them. Doing so makes it impossible
to recover from a ransomware attack unless you have an offline/off-site backup.

If you wish to configure Shadow Copies within the attached VM, see below.
	1-right-click on c:\ Dive icon and then config shadow copies

Transferring Files From Your Host - SCP (SSH)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secure copy, or SCP, is just that -- a means of securely copying files. Unlike the regular cp command, this command allows you to transfer files between two computers using 
				     the SSH protocol to provide both authentication and encryption.
	
Working on a model of SOURCE and DESTINATION, SCP allows you to:
	Copy files & directories from your current system to a remote system
	Copy files & directories from a remote system to your current system
	Provided that we know usernames and passwords for a user on your current system and a user on the remote system. For example, let's copy an example file from our 
		machine to a remote machine, which I have neatly laid out in the table below:
			Values:
			remote system 192.168.1.30
			User on the remote systemubuntu
			systemtransferred.txt : file being strored on remote computer 
(FORMAT is just SOURCE and DESTINATION)

		"scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt"

Copy a file from a remote computer that we're not logged into VariableValue
			remote system192.168.1.30
			User on the remote systemubuntu
			Name of the file on the remote systemdocuments.txt
			Name that we wish to store the file as on our systemnotes.txSCP 

		"scp important.txt ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt"

ARP 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Address Resolution Protocol” is a protocol for mapping an IP address to a physical MAC address on a local area network. Basically, ARP is a program used by a computer system
to find another computer's MAC address based on its IP address.
	1- ping sweep to discover all device on NW nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254
	2- nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24

Proccesses
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To see the processes run by other users and those that don't run from a session (i.e. system processes), we need to provide aux to the ps command like so: ps aux
kill PID 1337, we'd use kill 1337.
Below are some of the signals that we can send to a process when it is killed:
	SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup tasks beforehand
	SIGKILL - Kill the process - doesn't do any cleanup after the fact
	SIGSTOP - Stop/suspend a process
systemctl:
	Start
	Stop
	Enable
	Disable
	start process-stop-process-enable-process -disable-process
	setting enable & disable process on boot up and down

Windows Files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
windows files  Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively Window Explorer doesn't display ADS
to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files.

From a security perspective, malware writers have used ADS to hide data.
This is where environment variables, more specifically system environment variables, come into play. Even though not discussed yet, the system  environment variable for 
the Windows directory is %windir%.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment Vars
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Per Microsoft, "Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This information includes details such as the operating system path, the
number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders".

The environment variables store data that is used by the operating system and other programs. For example, the WINDIR environment variable contains the location of the
Windows installation directory. Programs can query the value of this variable to determine where Windows operating system files are located".

Click on Environment Variables to see the assigned values for the virtual machine.
	Another method to view environment variables is 
  Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables OR Settings > System > About > system info > Advanced system settings > 
  Environment Variables
	We're continuing with Tools that are available through the System Configuration panel.

Winsows .msc for advance configs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another way to access this information, and then some, is using Local User and Group Management. 
Right-click on the Start Menu and click Run. 
	Type lusrmgr.msc
		User Account Control (UAC)
	compmgmt
		WMI Control configures and controls the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service.
			Per Wikipedia, "WMI allows scripting languages (such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell) to manage Microsoft Windows personal computers and servers,
			both locally and remotely. Microsoft also provides a command-line interface to WMI called Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC)."
				Note: The WMIC tool is deprecated in Windows 10, version 21H1. Windows PowerShell supersedes this tool for WMI.
What is the System Information (msinfo32) tool?

Per Microsoft, "Windows includes a tool called Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe).  This tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive
view of your hardware, system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues."

The  information in System Summary is divided into three sections:
		Hardware Resources
		Components
		Software Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resource Monitor
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Per Microsoft, "Resource Monitor displays per-process and aggregate CPU, memory, disk, and network usage information, in addition to providing details about which processes
are using individual file handles and modules. Advanced filtering allows users to isolate the data related to one or more processes 
(either applications or services), start, stop, pause, and resume services, and close unresponsive applications from the user interface. It also includes a process analysis 
feature that can help identify deadlocked processes and file locking conflicts so that the user can attempt to resolve the conflict instead of closing an application 
and potentially losing data."

In the Overview tab, Resmon has four sections:
	CPU
	Disk
	Network
	Memory

simple commands, such as hostname and whoami.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netstat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command is netstat. Per the help manual, this command will display protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections.
et command is primarily used to manage network resources. This command supports sub-commands.
If you type net without a sub-command, the output will show the syntax for the root command showing a few of the sub-commands you can use.

For the net command, to display the help manual /? will not work. In this case, you need to use different syntax, which is net help.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are various ways to view/edit the registry. One way is to use the Registry Editor (regedit).
BitLocker?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Per Microsoft, "BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from
lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers".
Tip: Command to open the Windows Defender Firewall is WF.msc.
Core isolation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory Integrity - Prevents attacks from inserting malicious code into high-security processes.
What is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?

Per Microsoft, "Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is
designed to carry out cryptographic operations. The chip includes multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper-resistant, and malicious software is unable to 
tamper with the security functions of the TPM".
Per Microsoft, the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) coordinates the required actions to create a consistent shadow copy (also known as a snapshot or a point-in-time copy) 
of the data that is to be backed up.
