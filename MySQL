MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL)
(default) PORT 3306
Database:
        A database is simply a persistent, organised collection of structured data

RDBMS:
        A software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. The word "relational" just means that the data stored in the 
        dataset is organised as tables. Every table relates in some way to each other's "primary key" or other "key" factors.

SQL:
        MYSQL is just a brand name for one of the most popular RDBMS software implementations. CLient & server communicate a language, specifically the 
        Structured Query Language (SQL).

        Many other products, such as PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL server, have the word SQL in them. This similarly signifies that this is a product utilising 
        the Structured Query Language syntax.

How does MySQL work?
        MySQL, as an RDBMS, is made up of a server and utility programs that help in the administration of MySQL databases.
        The server handles all database instructions like creating, editing, and accessing data. It takes and manages these requests and communicates using the 
        MySQL protocol. This whole process can be broken down into these stages:

                MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
                Clients make requests by making specific statements in SQL.
                The server will respond to the client with whatever information has been requested.
What runs MySQL?

MySQL can run on various platforms, whether it's Linux or windows. It is commonly used as a back end database for many prominent websites and forms an essential 
component of the LAMP stack, which includes: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
