NTLMv1 & NTLMv2 Relay ATTACKS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          \\ SMB SIGNING prevents these Attacks - however SMB signing is off by feault and recommended to keep off die to speed
LLMNR posining: LinkLocalMulticastNameResolution - Windows component used to identify hosts when DNS fails- if DNS fails machine will communicate w/ other machines using LLMNR
                and ask if anyone knows a particular host
                
                1- CLIENT sends a req to who is //pintserver DNS will fail to resolve 
                2- CLIENT LLMNR will ask other devices if the know //pintserver
                3- ATTACKER on NW can sit & Listen for LLMNR broadcasts 
                4- ATTACKER will reply saying it knows //pintserver & tells CLIENT to pass them their HASH and they will connect them to the SERVER '//pintserver'
                5- CLINET sends hash - ATTACKER will then crack HASH and now have the CLIENTS password

TOOLS : Responder is used by ATTACKER
               # responder -I eth0 -rdwv
               ~make sure poissoners are [on]
               ~verify appropiate [servers] are [on]
               ~wait and listen 
               ~store hash and crack - HASH is stored as NTLMv2    NOTE: strong passwords are hard to crack!!
