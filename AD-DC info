1-Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller as well as password hashes for domain users
2-Stored by default in %SystemRoot%\NTDS
3-accessible only by the domain controller

Forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole.

The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:
        Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
        Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
        Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
        Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
        Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
        Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
        Domain Schema - Rules for object creation

Domain Trusts Overview -

Trusts are a mechanism in place for users in the network to gain access to other resources in the domain. For the most part, trusts outline the way that the domains inside 
of a forest communicate to each other, in some environments trusts can be extended out to external domains and even forests in some cases.

There are two types of trusts that determine how the domains communicate. I'll outline the two types of trusts below: 

      Directional - The direction of the trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain
      Transitive - The trust relationship expands beyond just two domains to include other trusted domains The type of trusts put in place determines how the domains and
                   trees in a forest are able to communicate and send data to and from each other when attacking an Active Directory environment you can sometimes abuse 
                   these trusts in order to move laterally throughout the network. 

Digitally Sign Communication (Always) - Can disable or enable SMB signing on the domain controller
