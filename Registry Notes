Registry TRANSACTION logs & BACKUP
transaction logs can be considered as the journal of the changelog of the registry hive. Windows often uses transaction logs when writing data to registry hives. 
*These logs have the latest changes in the registry that haven't made their way to the registry hives themselves. 
located in C:\Windows\System32\Config in the filename SAM.LOG

Registry backups are the opposite of Transaction logs. located in the C:\Windows\System32\Config directory. 
These hives are copied to the C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack directory every ten days. 
*If registry keys might have been DELETED/MODIFIED recently.
