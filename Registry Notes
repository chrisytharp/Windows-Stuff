------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting w/ Windows 2000, this info is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes key has settings that override the default settings and apply to that interactive user

Computer online acess Regedit.exe access registry 
Computer Offline access C:\Windows\System32\Config directory and are:

                        DEFAULT (mounted on HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT)
                        SAM (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM)

2 other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory (!These are Hidden Files!)
        NTUSER.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER when a user logs in)
        USRCLASS.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CLASSES)
        
        The USRCLASS.DAT hive is located in the directory C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
        The NTUSER.DAT hive is located in the directory C:\Users\<username>\

Amcache Hive:
located in C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve. Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.

Transaction Logs and Backups:

Registry TRANSACTION logs & BACKUP
transaction logs can be considered as the journal of the changelog of the registry hive. Windows often uses transaction logs when writing data to registry hives. 
*These logs have the latest changes in the registry that haven't made their way to the registry hives themselves. 
located in C:\Windows\System32\Config in the filename SAM.LOG

Registry backups are the opposite of Transaction logs. located in the C:\Windows\System32\Config directory. 
These hives are copied to the C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack directory every ten days. 
*If registry keys might have been DELETED/MODIFIED recently.

SYSTEM INFO & ACCOUNTS
----------------------
Get OS version ->  SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion

Current control set ->
      The hives containing the machineâ€™s configuration data used for controlling SYSTEM STARTUP are called Control Sets. Commonly, we will see two Control Sets, 
      ControlSet001 and ControlSet002, in the SYSTEM hive on a machine. In most cases, ControlSet001 will point to the Control Set that the machine booted with,
      and ControlSet002 will be the last known good configuration. Their locations will be:
                               located -> SYSTEM\ControlSet001
                               located -> SYSTEM\ControlSet002

      Windows creates a volatile Control Set when the machine is live, called the CurrentControlSet (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet). For getting the most accurate 
      system information, this is the hive that we will refer to. We can find out which Control Set is being used as the CurrentControlSet by looking at the 
      following registry value:
                              located -> SYSTEM\Select\Current

      Similarly, the last known good configuration can be found using the following registry value:
                              located -> SYSTEM\Select\LastKnownGood
        
Computer Name -> SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName 

Time Zone Information -> SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation

ShellBags -> When any user opens a folder, it opens in a specific layout. Users can change this layout according to their preferences. 
            These layouts can be different for different folders. This info about the Windows 'shell' is stored and can identify the Most Recently Used files and folders.

EVIDENCE OF EXECUTION
----------------------
UserAssist -> Windows keeps track of applications launched by the user using Windows Explorer. These keys contain information about the programs launched, the
              time of their launch, and the number of times they were executed. However, programs that were run using the command line can't be found in the User Assist keys.

                      NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Currentversion\Explorer\UserAssist\{GUID}\Count
                      
ShimCache a.k.a. (Application Compatibility Cache (AppCompatCache))-> mechanism used to keep track of application compatibility with the OS and tracks all
                  applications launched on the machine. Its main purpose is to ensure backward compatibility of applications. 

                      SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache

                  ShimCache stores file name, file size, and last modified time of the executables.

AmCache -> is an artifact related to ShimCache. This performs a similar function to ShimCache, and stores additional data related to program executions. 
           This data includes execution path, installation, execution and deletion times, and SHA1 hashes of the executed programs. 

                      C:\Windows\appcompat\Programs\Amcache.hve

          Information about the last executed programs can be found at the following location in the hive:

                        Amcache.hve\Root\File\{Volume GUID}\

BAM/DAM (Background Activity Monitor) -> keeps a tab on the activity of background applications. Similar (Desktop Activity Moderator) or DAM is a part of 
            Microsoft Windows that optimizes the power consumption of the device.
            contains information about last run programs, their full paths, and last execution time.

Pre-fetch -> When a program is run in Windows, it stores its information for future use. This info is used to load the program quickly in case of frequent use.
             Prefetch files have an extension of .pf. PF files contain the last run times of the application, the number of times the application was run, 
             and any files and device handles used by the file
                                 located -> C:\Windows\Prefetch directory
                                 
Windows 10 Timeline -> Win10 stores recently used applications & files in an SQLite database called the Windows 10 Timeline. This data can be a source of 
                       info about the last executed programs. Contains the application that was executed and the focus time of the application. 
                                 located ->  C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\{randomfolder}\ActivitiesCache.db

Windows Jump Lists -> helps users go directly to their recently used files from the taskbar. View jumplists by right-clicking an application's icon in the taskbar,
                      and it will show us the recently opened files in that application.
           Jumplists include information about the applications executed, first time of execution, and last time of execution of the application against an AppID.
                                  located -> C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations

Shortcut Files -> Windows creates a shortcut file for each file opened either locally or remotely. The shortcut files contain information about the first and last 
                  opened times of the file and the path of the opened file, along with some other data.
                                  located -> C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\

IE/Edge history -> Browsing history includes files opened in the system as well, whether those files were opened using the browser or not.
                   source of info on opened files in a system is the IE/Edge history. 
                                  located -> C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\WebCacheV*.dat
