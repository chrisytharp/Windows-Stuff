Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes
key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes key has settings that override the 
default settings and apply only to the interactive use

2 other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory (!These are Hidden Files!)
        NTUSER.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER when a user logs in)
        USRCLASS.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CLASSES)
        
        The USRCLASS.DAT hive is located in the directory C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows
        The NTUSER.DAT hive is located in the directory C:\Users\<username>\

Amcache Hive:
located in C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve. Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.

Transaction Logs and Backups:

Registry TRANSACTION logs & BACKUP
transaction logs can be considered as the journal of the changelog of the registry hive. Windows often uses transaction logs when writing data to registry hives. 
*These logs have the latest changes in the registry that haven't made their way to the registry hives themselves. 
located in C:\Windows\System32\Config in the filename SAM.LOG

Registry backups are the opposite of Transaction logs. located in the C:\Windows\System32\Config directory. 
These hives are copied to the C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack directory every ten days. 
*If registry keys might have been DELETED/MODIFIED recently.

Get OS version ->  SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion
Current control set ->
      The hives containing the machineâ€™s configuration data used for controlling SYSTEM STARTUP are called Control Sets. Commonly, we will see two Control Sets, 
      ControlSet001 and ControlSet002, in the SYSTEM hive on a machine. In most cases, ControlSet001 will point to the Control Set that the machine booted with,
      and ControlSet002 will be the last known good configuration. Their locations will be:

         SYSTEM\ControlSet001
         SYSTEM\ControlSet002

      Windows creates a volatile Control Set when the machine is live, called the CurrentControlSet (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet). For getting the most accurate 
      system information, this is the hive that we will refer to. We can find out which Control Set is being used as the CurrentControlSet by looking at the 
      following registry value:

         SYSTEM\Select\Current

      Similarly, the last known good configuration can be found using the following registry value:

        SYSTEM\Select\LastKnownGood
        
Computer Name -> SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName 
Time Zone Information -> SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation
Network Interfaces and Past Networks -> SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces
The past networks a given machine was connected to can be found in the following locations ->
                                      SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Unmanaged
                                      SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Managed
Autostart Programs (Autoruns) -> 
                                  NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
                                  NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
                                  SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
                                  SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\Run
                                  SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
Services -> SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services   "if the start key is set to 0x02, this means that this service will start at boot"

SAM hive and user information:SAM hive contains user account information, login information, and group information
-> SAM\Domains\Account\Users

(MRU) Most Recently Used File -> a list of recently opened files for each user -> NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs
  To specifically view the last used PDF files, we can look at the following registry key: or .jpg .docx etc
                                          NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs\.pdf
